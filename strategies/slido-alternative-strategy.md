# AnswerThis: "The Simpler Slido" Marketing Strategy

*Created: 2026-01-29*

## Strategic Position

**Core message:** "Slido does 100 things. You need one. Q&A."

We're not trying to beat Slido at everything. We're positioning as the focused alternative for people who find Slido overkill.

## Target Audience

### Primary: Independent Speakers & Trainers
- **Profile:** Professional speakers, workshop facilitators, corporate trainers
- **Event size:** 30-200 attendees
- **Pain points:**
  - Don't need polls, quizzes, word clouds
  - Don't want to learn complex software
  - Care about speaker view readability
  - Price-conscious (not reimbursed by enterprise)

### Secondary: Small Event Organizers
- **Profile:** Conference organizers, meetup hosts, company town halls
- **Event size:** 50-500 attendees
- **Pain points:**
  - Slido's free tier is too limited
  - Don't want enterprise sales calls
  - Need quick setup, one-time use

### Anti-Persona (Don't Target)
- Enterprise companies with Cisco/Microsoft stack
- Educators with LMS requirements
- Event agencies needing full-featured platforms

## Value Proposition Canvas

### Jobs to Be Done

2. Moderate and organize questions
3. Display questions to speaker clearly
4. Increase audience participation

### Pains
- Slido is confusing/overwhelming
- Don't want to pay for features they won't use
- Audience hates downloading apps
- Hard to read questions while presenting

### Gains
- More audience questions than before
