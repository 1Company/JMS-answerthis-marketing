## 🏆 KEY INSIGHT

**"Slido alternative" SEO is the #1 growth lever.**

People actively search for Slido alternatives. If we rank for this:
- High-intent traffic (ready to try)
- No ad spend needed
- Sustainable long-term

**Priority order:**
1. /vs-slido page (do TODAY)
2. AlternativeTo listing
3. Comparison blog content
4. Everything else

---

## ⚠️ DON'T DO

- ❌ Target enterprise (Slido owns that)
- ❌ Build features to compete with Slido (stay simple)
- ❌ Paid ads on broad keywords
- ❌ Spam speaker communities
- ❌ Lie in comparisons (be honest about Slido's strengths)
