## Template 1: Cold Outreach to Professional Speakers

**Subject:** Quick Q&A upgrade for your next talk

Hi [Name],

I saw your [talk/workshop] at [Event]—loved your take on [topic].

Quick question: How do you currently handle Q&A during your presentations?

I built a tool called AnswerThis specifically for speakers like you. It's simpler than Slido (no polls, no quizzes, just Q&A) with a speaker display designed to be readable from 10 feet away.

The pitch: Your audience scans a QR code, types questions throughout your talk, and you see them on a clean display when Q&A time comes.

Would you be open to trying it at your next event? It's free to start, and I'd love your feedback.

Best,

## Template 4: After Speaker Signs Up (Onboarding)

**Subject:** Welcome! Here's how to nail Q&A at your next talk

Hi [Name],

Thanks for signing up for AnswerThis! Here's how to make the most of it:

**Before your talk:**
1. Create your session (takes 60 seconds)
2. Add the QR code to your opening slide

**During your talk:**
1. Point to the QR code in your intro
2. Say: "Drop your questions here anytime—we'll get to them at the end"
3. Glance at incoming questions during breaks (optional)

**During Q&A:**
1. Open the speaker display
2. Click questions to expand/dismiss
3. Use keyboard shortcuts for speed (spacebar = next, esc = dismiss)

**Pro tip:** The best questions usually come 10-15 minutes into your talk. Early submission lets introverts participate.

Questions? Just reply.

Break a leg!

## Template 5: Outreach to Corporate Training Departments

**Subject:** Better Q&A for internal training sessions

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] runs a lot of internal training and workshops. Quick question: How do you currently handle audience Q&A?

I built AnswerThis for exactly this use case. It's a simple Q&A tool (no Slido bloat) that lets employees ask questions anonymously during sessions.

Benefits for training:
- Anonymous = honest questions (especially about sensitive topics)
- No app downloads = no IT headaches
- Trainers see questions on a clean display

Would you be open to a quick demo? Takes 10 minutes and I can show you how it works with your existing workflow.

Best,
[Your name]

## Template 7: Comparison Content Pitch (for Bloggers/Newsletter Writers)

**Subject:** Content idea: "Slido alternatives for speakers"

Hi [Name],

Love your content on [speaking/events/tech]—especially your piece on [specific article].

I wanted to pitch a content idea: A comparison of Q&A tools for speakers and trainers.

Most comparisons focus on enterprise features, but speakers have different needs:
- Simple setup (no time for complex tools)
- Speaker-optimized display (readable from stage)
- Affordable (not enterprise pricing)

I built AnswerThis as a Slido alternative for this exact market. Happy to provide:
- Free access for your review
- Data on speaker needs (from our users)
- Quote or interview

Would this fit your content calendar?

Best,
[Your name]
