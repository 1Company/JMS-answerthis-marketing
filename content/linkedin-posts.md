## Post 1: The Problem with Overbuilt Tools

🤯 **I needed a Q&A tool. I got a spaceship.**

All I wanted:
- Let my audience ask questions
- See them on screen
- Pick the good ones

What Slido gave me:
- Polls
- Quizzes
- Word clouds
- Integrations
- A 30-page documentation

I just want to do Q&A.

So I found a simpler way. (Details in comments)

## Post 2: The Simplicity Pitch

⚡ **The best Q&A tool is one you forget exists.**

Here's my setup for seminars:

1. Open the tool (5 seconds)
2. Show the QR code on slide 1 (1 second)
3. Forget about it

When Q&A time comes:
- Questions are waiting
- I pick from speaker display
- Audience feels heard

No polls. No quizzes. No learning curve.

Just questions and answers.

That's how Q&A should work.

## Post 3: Speaker Pain Point

🎤 **Fellow speakers: Can you relate?**

"Hold on, let me find that question..."
*squints at laptop*
*scrolls through tiny text*
*loses eye contact with audience*
*awkward silence*

The solution: A Q&A display DESIGNED for speakers.

- Large text
- High contrast
- Visible from 10 feet away
- One-click selection

Never lose your flow again.

## Post 4: Audience Perspective

🙋 **Why your audience isn't asking questions:**

1. Fear of speaking up publicly
2. Don't want to interrupt
3. Question feels "too basic"
4. Might look stupid

The fix: Let them type instead.

Anonymous text questions = 3x more participation.

(And they're often better questions because people think before they type.)

Stop asking "Any questions?" to silence.
Give them a way to ask silently.

## Post 5: Case Study Format

📊 **Before/After: Q&A at my last workshop**

**Before (raising hands):**
- Questions asked: 4
- Participation: Front row only
- Types: Safe, basic questions

**After (anonymous text submission):**
- Questions asked: 23
- Participation: Entire room
- Types: Real questions, including tough ones

Same audience. Same topic. Same speaker.

Different method.

Anonymous submission changes everything.

## Post 7: How-To Value Post

💡 **5 tips for better Q&A sessions:**

1. **Start early** - Show the QR code on your first slide, not your last

2. **Encourage anonymous** - "No question is too basic"

3. **Preview questions** - Glance at submissions during breaks

4. **Acknowledge volume** - "We have 15 questions—let's dive in!"

5. **Follow up** - "Great question from the app: ..."

Bonus: The best questions often come from introverts who'd never raise their hand.

Which tip will you try next?

## Post 8: Direct CTA

📣 **Speakers: If you're still using "raise your hand" for Q&A...**

You're leaving questions on the table.

Try this instead:

→ Display a QR code on your opening slide
→ Audience submits questions throughout
→ When Q&A comes, you have a queue ready

No app downloads.
No audience friction.
No fumbling for questions.
